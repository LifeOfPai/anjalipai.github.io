##Products must be designed with ethics in mind##

Throughout the design process we have discussed ethics and ways in which technology can sometimes violate ethical standards. It is evident that the consideration of ethics both during the research and design process and in the final design of a product, is crucial. However, ethics should not be treated as an afterthought. The silicon valley motto, “move fast and break things” can lead to designers and programmers neglecting ethical concerns or potential ethics violations in order to engage in a rapid iteration process. Moreover, it is critical for programmers and designers to possess a strong personal code of ethics in regard to what they believe the boundaries and limitations of their product should be. The personal code of ethics that I have developed through this process is as follows:
* Designers should be transparent about the features of their product - A large number of ethics violations result from companies employing or possessing a feature that is hidden from users. The Uber Greyball is a perfect example of a hidden feature that Uber was able to exploit to avoid authorities in areas where Uber was banned. In the Strava case, the issue was a lack of clear information about the kind of data Strava collected about users in the “heat map” feature. Companies are able to get away with such ethics violations when they are not transparent about the features their product has or how it can be used. Therefore as a designer, I would make it a priority to be transparent about every critical feature, especially those that have the potential to be manipulated.
* Design flaws that pose ethical violations should be treated as top priority - This means that when an issue is discovered that poses ethical concerns (for example in the cases of Strava or the Therac-25) they should be treated as the top priority. Rather than attempting to impose a “quick fix”, it is the designer/programmer’s duty to identify the root cause of the flaw, and implement a permanent solution. In some cases this may mean recalling and redesigning the product. This is what the primary issue was with the AECL’s Corrective Action Plan in response to the deaths caused by Therac-25: they treated it as an insignificant error to be “bandaged” instead of a severe problem that required, at minimum, rigorous testing prior to future use
* Do not cause harm - This one is relatively self-explanatory. Designers should ensure that any features of their product are same from manipulation or use in a way that poses harm to others. This harm can be physical, emotional, or mental.
* Protection of Information is critical - Users of a product should be confident that the information they are providing is secure. If that information is being used for other purposes (eg. research) the user has a right to know (and not in fine print). Companies should be clear and  upfront about how they use data. This is how we avoid scandals such as Cambridge Analytica. 

##Accessibility helps everyone, not just users with disabilities##

A key takeaway regarding accessibility is that ensuring that products are accessible is not necessarily about catering to disabled users, but about designing for the benefit of all users. The “curb-cut effect” as it is often called, pushes designers to “solve for one, extend to the many”. As such, accessibility should be a consideration in every stage of the design process. In my own work, I would be inclined to take the approach of the POUR methodology where in each stage of the design phase, we consider whether the content we are adding or designing is: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. I find these categories to be valuable because they encompass visual components, physical or interactive components, cognitive processing, and robustness. If a designer were to consider these four elements at each stage of the process, they would likely uncover potential barriers to accessibility prior to even adding a feature. Therefore, issues of accessibility can be addressed during the design process when there is a lower barrier to making modifications, rather than after the fact when barriers to adding or revamping features may be higher. 

Although we did not have the opportunity to consider accessibility in every stage of the design process, once we were aware of the ways that technology can be made accessible, we began to employ that in our process. For example, with our digital prototype, we carefully considered the color palette. [Add photo + description].

##The designer is not the user##

This was probably the biggest takeaway from our design process. I began this process fairly confident that I understood “art amateurs”: after all, I had coined the term to describe people similar to myself. However, after only two contextual inquiries it became obvious that the group of “art amateurs” we were catering to was far more diverse that we had anticipated. Contrary to my expectation, for example, one of our contextual inquiry participants expressed being content with the fact that art museums were a space for people who cared about art, rather than being frustrated that museums were not more accessible to people of all backgrounds and interests.

Throughout our research process, the fact that the designer is not the user was reinforced. During our usability tests, we discovered that features we believed to be self-explanatory were not at all obvious to our users. In retrospect this is very reasonable: as designers of our product our mental models matched our expectations of how the design would be used. The users were not, however, guaranteed to share our same mental models, which is why the burden fell on us to ensure that the design matched the user’s mental model.

##Simplicity over complexity##

I was initially concerned that our final design was too simple; yet in our final usability tests it seemed like the simplicity was what appealed most to users. Initial iterations of our design contained a large amount of text. The final design uses more pictures and visualizations than text, which we discovered is preferable to users. 

##The first design is rarely the best design##

The iterative design process was critical to achieving a final product that served our primary tasks in a clean and effective way.
