### Overview of the Paper

A paper I found especially interesting and relevant to our design is Framework of Product Experience (2007), written by Pieter Desmet and Paul Hekkert. The paper presents a framework of “product experience” that consists of three categories: “aesthetic experience”, “experience of meaning” and “emotional experience”. The authors begin by defining product experience as “all possible affective experiences involved in human-product interaction” (2). They focus on both the physical act of interacting with a product, but non-physical interactions (such as anticipating or thinking about a product) that may also cause some emotional affect. In introducing this idea of product experience, the authors point out that the primary ways feelings are often expressed relate to categories of affect: “ the behavioural impact of an experience (‘I was so angry: I felt like throwing my computer out of the window’), the expression (‘he game was so boring: I couldn’t stop yawning’), or the physiological reaction (‘I was trembling from fear when I noticed the smoke emerging from my kitchen’)” (3). The remainder of the paper focuses on breaking down the three levels of prduct experience. The first, aesthetic experience is defined as “a product’s capacity to delight one or more of our sensory modalities” or the way in which the look, feel and other sensory elements of a product can produce an emotional response. Experience of meaning is defined as “semantic interpretations” or “symbolic associations” linked to a product. This can include relating to products that share your “personality” or that are associated with certain memories or meanings. The final category is emotional experience which the authors define as the emotional reaction inspired by the “interpretation of an event” that reflects the significance of an event or action for a person’s well-being. The primary conclusion the authors draw is that these three categories are the primary explanations for the emotional responses people associate with products. Different products may activate different levels of experience and although these three elements of experience are distinguishable, they often blend together in everyday interactions with products. Specifically, they argue that “in order to understand emotional responses to human-product interaction, one must understand the users’ concerns given the context in which he or she interacts with the product”. 

I do agree with their argument that our emotional response to a product is influenced not only by the aesthetics of the product but with the meaning we associate with it and whether it serves the specific expectations or desires we have for it in a given context. Their description of these three elements of “product experience” seem to line up well with experiences I’ve had using various products throughout my life: specifically the fact that my feelings about products change depending on the context of the experience I am having with the product.

### Applications to our project

Although this paper is a little over 10 years old, the research seems to be referenced in more modern studies and as it is based on psychological theory, I would consider it to still hold today. One thought that this paper inspired was that in our design process, we seem to have focused significantly on “emotional experience”: on increasing the well-being of the museum-goer by improving their museum experience. We put far less consideration into the “aesthetic experience” and the “experience of meaning” and given that those play an equal part in the emotions evoked by a product, it would have been valuable to have spent more time honing those elements. Specifically, I fear that the slightly child-like design of our design might have associated meanings of childhood that may potentially dissuade some users from using the design (especially if they have non-positive associations with childishness). Similarly, I would have liked to have run more user studies with our design in an actual art museum to gauge whether it serves users needs within the actual context they would use it. One way our design does build off of this work is using our product specifically to evoke certain emotions in users, specifically to cultivate a feeling of comfort and community for museum-goers. In this sense we have more intentionally employed the idea of “product experience” than the paper advocates for.
