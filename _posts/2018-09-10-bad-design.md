title: Bad Design
subtitle: Peoplesoft more like PeopleHARD

The Williams Peoplesoft website represents an example of bad design that is especially frustrating to me. The design of the peoplesoft website has always been unattractive; however two years ago there was an update to the Peoplesoft website which I was initially quite excited about. Instead of improving the website, however, the update somehow managed to make the website even more poorly designed.

The renovated Peoplesoft website has an aesthetically pleasing home screen. The three center icons are large and contain images as icons. The images add to the aesthetic appeal. Overall, the home page is simple but seems to be a welcoming interface for students. It is beyond this screen, however, that the design flaws are most obvious.

Upon pressing the main menu button, one would expect to be redirected to the main menu, but instead, we are directed to a page that looks exactly like the old Peoplesoft website. The page is entirely blank with no links except for two tabs at the top of the page: "Favorites" and "Main Menu". COmpared to the size of the page, these tabs are rather small and therefore easy to miss at first glance. The bareness of the page is also frustrating because it seems to be a waste of space.

If you click on the Main Menu tab, it presents a drop down menu that you then have to navigate to find the link you want. Not only is the drop down menu unintuitive, but its organization is not clear in the slightest. What is even more frustrating is that you then have to hover over the folder that says "Self Service" in order to get to important links such as "Academic Records" or "Dining Services". Thus the links that students would most readily need to access are nested wither two or three folders deep into this drop down menu, which makes the process of accessing them convoluted and unnecessarily complex.

What I did discover on my soul-searching journey through Peoplesoft is that there is an option to personalize the home page, so that instead of being bare, it contains the links and menus that you would otherwise have to scour the dropdown menu for. However, it is not immediately obvious that personalizing this page is even an option. The button to open the personalization options is in the corner of the page in small text, obscured in a way that would make it easily missable if you were not paying close attention.

Again, even on the personalization menu, the meaning of the different options is not clear. I randomly selected a few that sounded correct but I had to use trial and error to find the correct options. Once I did so, I was able to update my peoplesoft as such:

ALthough this is a slight improvement, the overall layout is still unappealing and there is far too much compartmentalization and nesting of folders for this to be an effective website. What angers me most about the Peoplesoft update is that in updating the website, the designers simply added an attractive facade infront of the existing poorly designed website. This added facade did not make it easier to find information on peoplesoft, but instead just added another step that the user has to take (another button they have to push) on top of the existing steps they already had to take. This design is "bad" because it requires an unnecessary amount of work on the part of the student, and thus is cumbersome and tedious to use. It is additinally frustrating that from a programmer's perspective, it seems like it would be a relatively painless task to make the peoplesoft website more user-friendly, yet no steps have been taken to improve the design.
