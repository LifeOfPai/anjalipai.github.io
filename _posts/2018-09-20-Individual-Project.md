## Meet the Art Amateurs
Not everyone “understands” art. Some people have difficulty spending even a few minutes in an art museum, nevertheless spending multiple hours. Certain people can stare at a work of art and ask a million questions: Who was the artist? Why did they paint this way? What does this painting mean? Other people feel like they may as well be staring at a blank canvas.

I know this because I am one of those people. I have always had an appreciation for art but I have always struggled to walk around an art museum and examine art in the way that an art major or even an art enthusiast would. It is highly probably that I am not the only “art amateur” in this world. You see this all the time in art museums: certain people spend hours walking around, examining each painting; others wander the rooms more aimlessly, eventually growing tired or bored and finding themselves searching for the nearest bench or cafe. 

## The Problem
The real problem is not that such art amateurs exist, but that art museums do not cater to the art amateurs. When a museum has audio tours they often include in-depth historical background information or quotes from curators. These are helpful in providing some context to art but they too are geared toward people with an intellectual curiosity about art. In WCMA for example, the small plaques next to each work of art display the name of the painter, the rough time period of painting, and information about the medium: information that is interesting to an artist or an art student, but does nothing to help and “art amateur” better appreciate the art. But basic information is the only thing that most art museums have. They cannot teach people how to appreciate art, they can only tell people what questions to think about or what context to consider.

# Further Evidence #
I'm not making this up. in a HuffPost article called [_How You Expect To Feel at An Art Museum vs How You Really Feel_!](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/how-to-act-at-an-art-muse_n_6023610.html), Katherine Brooks describes the phenomenon of feeling lost in an art museum even if you thing art is beautiful and enjoy a certain amount of art in your life. 



## How can we help?
Since it is difficult to understand how to help art amateurs appreciate art, we can instead consider the following question: In what scenario do art amateurs actually enjoy an art museum? One answer is when there’s a particular exhibit of interest: something they’ve encountered previously in their life, or heard of in other areas of their life that they are more interested in. An English major may have interest in seeing an exhibit based off of The Picture of Dorian Gray or Pride and Prejudice; a math major may be intrigued by an exhibit of DaVinci’s sketches. It is difficult, however for a museum to curate their exhibitions as to appeal to all of the potential art amateurs out there.

## Art As a Social Experience
Another more interesting case is in social settings. For an art amateur, walking around an art museum on their own can be an isolating and frustrating experience. You don’t understand the art, you have questions, you feel like everyone around you is more of an art connoisseur than you are. You could ask other people about their thoughts on the art, but initiating that kind of interaction with strangers can be stressful and anxiety inducing. What most people really want in that kind of situation is to be surrounded by people like them: not art students or museum experts or art museum frequenters, but other “art amateurs”. Imagine a world where we could connect all the art amateurs, or provide them with a way to hear the questions or thoughts of other people with the same layman’s view as them. Simple questions like: Why is there an angel in this picture? Why this person's face so ugly? How do two boxes painted on a canvas represent a “boy with a knapsack”?. Basic observations like: this painting seems silly; the colors don’t work together. And, possibly more importantly, stories: “This painting reminds me of the time when…”; “The scene looks like....”; “This painting makes me feel…”. The goal is to help the art amateurs feel less alone in an environment they feel out of place in, and one of the best ways to do this is to create a community that they can carry in their pocket and access on the fly.
